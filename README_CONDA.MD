### Building identical conda environments
You can use explicit specification files to build an identical conda environment on the same operating system platform, either on the same machine or on a different machine.
Run `conda list --explicit` to produce a spec list such as

    (tutorial-env-py36) Bernhards-MacBook-Pro:tutorials bernhardsteindl$ conda list --explicit
    # This file may be used to create an environment using:
    # $ conda create --name <env> --file <this file>
    # platform: osx-64

To create this spec list as a file in the current working directory, run:

    conda list --explicit > spec-file.txt

To use the spec file to create an identical environment on the same machine or another machine:

    conda create --name myenv --file spec-file.txt

To use the spec file to install its listed packages into an existing environment:

    conda install --name myenv --file spec-file.txt

To see a list of all packages installed in a specific environment:
If the environment is activated, in your terminal window or an Anaconda Prompt, run:

    conda list

If the environment is not activated, in your terminal window or an Anaconda Prompt, run:

    conda list -n myenv

You may want to share your environment with someone else---for example, so they can re-create a test that you have done. To allow them to quickly reproduce your environment, with all of its packages and versions, give them a copy of your `environment.yml` file.

### Exporting the environment.yml file

If you already have an `environment.yml` file in your current directory, it will be overwritten during this task.

Activate the environment to export: `conda activate myenv`
Export your active environment to a new file:

    conda env export > environment.yml

Email or copy the exported environment.yml file to the other person.

*Managing environments*
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#create-env-file-manually

=====================
Managing environments
=====================

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1

With conda, you can create, export, list, remove, and update
environments that have different versions of Python and/or
packages installed in them. Switching or moving between
environments is called activating the environment. You can also
share an environment file.

.. note::
   There are many options available for the commands described
   on this page. For details, see :doc:`../../commands`.

.. note::
   ``conda activate`` and ``conda deactivate`` only work on conda 4.6 and later versions.
   For conda versions prior to 4.6, run:

      * Windows: ``activate`` or ``deactivate``
      * Linux and macOS: ``source activate`` or ``source deactivate``

Creating an environment with commands
=====================================

.. tip::
   By default, environments are installed into the ``envs``
   directory in your conda directory. See :ref:`specifying-location`
   or run ``conda create --help`` for information on specifying
   a different path.

Use the terminal or an Anaconda Prompt for the following steps:

#. To create an environment:

   .. code::

      conda create --name myenv

   .. note::
      Replace ``myenv`` with the environment name.

#. When conda asks you to proceed, type ``y``:

   .. code::

      proceed ([y]/n)?

  This creates the myenv environment in ``/envs/``. This
  environment uses the same version of Python that you are
  currently using because you did not specify a version.

3. To create an environment with a specific version of Python:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda create -n myenv python=3.4

4. To create an environment with a specific package:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda create -n myenv scipy

   OR:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda create -n myenv python
      conda install -n myenv scipy

5. To create an environment with a specific version of a package:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda create -n myenv scipy=0.15.0

   OR:

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda create -n myenv python
      conda install -n myenv scipy=0.15.0

6. To create an environment with a specific version of Python and
   multiple packages:

  .. code-block:: bash

     conda create -n myenv python=3.4 scipy=0.15.0 astroid babel

  .. tip::
     Install all the programs that you want in this environment
     at the same time. Installing 1 program at a time can lead to
     dependency conflicts.

To automatically install pip or another program every time a new
environment is created, add the default programs to the
:ref:`create_default_packages <config-add-default-pkgs>` section
of your ``.condarc`` configuration file. The default packages are
installed every time you create a new environment. If you do not
want the default packages installed in a particular environment,
use the ``--no-default-packages`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda create --no-default-packages -n myenv python

.. tip::
   You can add much more to the ``conda create`` command.
   For details, run ``conda create --help``.


.. _create-env-from-file:

Creating an environment from an environment.yml file
====================================================

Use the terminal or an Anaconda Prompt for the following steps:

#. Create the environment from the ``environment.yml`` file:

   .. code::

      conda env create -f environment.yml

   The first line of the ``yml`` file sets the new environment's
   name. For details see :ref:`Creating an environment file manually
   <create-env-file-manually>`.


#. Activate the new environment: ``conda activate myenv``

#. Verify that the new environment was installed correctly:

   .. code::

      conda env list

  You can also use ``conda info --envs``.
  

.. _specifying-location:

Specifying a location for an environment
========================================

You can control where a conda environment lives by providing a path
to a target directory when creating the environment. For example,
the following command will create a new environment in a subdirectory
of the current working directory called ``envs``::

  conda create --prefix ./envs jupyterlab=0.35 matplotlib=3.1 numpy=1.16

You then activate an environment created with a prefix using the same
command used to activate environments created by name::
 
  conda activate ./envs
 
Specifying a path to a subdirectory of your project directory when
creating an environment has the following benefits: 

  * It makes it easy to tell if your project uses an isolated environment
    by including the environment as a subdirectory.
  * It makes your project more self-contained as everything, including
    the required software, is contained in a single project directory.

An additional benefit of creating your project’s environment inside a
subdirectory is that you can then use the same name for all your
environments. If you keep all of your environments in your ``envs``
folder, you’ll have to give each environment a different name.

There are a few things to be aware of when placing conda environments
outside of the default ``envs`` folder.
 
#. Conda can no longer find your environment with the ``--name`` flag.
   You’ll generally need to pass the ``--prefix`` flag along with the
   environment’s full path to find the environment.
#. Specifying an install path when creating your conda environments
   makes it so that your command prompt is now prefixed with the active
   environment’s absolute path rather than the environment’s name.

After activating an environment using its prefix, your prompt will
look similar to the following::

(/absolute/path/to/envs) $

This can result in long prefixes::

(/Users/USER_NAME/research/data-science/PROJECT_NAME/envs) $

To remove this long prefix in your shell prompt, modify the env_prompt
setting in your ``.condarc`` file::

$ conda config --set env_prompt '({name})'

This will edit your ``.condarc`` file if you already have one
or create a ``.condarc`` file if you do not.

Now your command prompt will display the active environment’s
generic name, which is the name of the environment's root folder:

.. code-block::

  $ cd project-directory
  $ conda activate ./env
  (env) project-directory $

.. _update-env:

Updating an environment
=======================
You may need to update your environment for a variety of reasons.
For example, it may be the case that:

* one of your core dependencies just released a new version
  (dependency version number update).
* you need an additional package for data analysis
  (add a new dependency).
* you have found a better package and no longer need the older
  package (add new dependency and remove old dependency).

If any of these occur, all you need to do is update the contents of
your environment.yml file accordingly and then run the following
command::

$ conda env update --prefix ./env --file environment.yml  --prune
 
Note that the --prune option causes conda to remove any dependencies
that are no longer required from the environment.


Cloning an environment
======================

Use the terminal or an Anaconda Prompt for the following steps:

You can make an exact copy of an environment by creating a clone
of it:

.. code::

   conda create --name myclone --clone myenv

.. note::
   Replace ``myclone`` with the name of the new environment.
   Replace ``myenv`` with the name of the existing environment that
   you want to copy.

To verify that the copy was made:

.. code::

   conda info --envs

In the environments list that displays, you should see both the
source environment and the new copy.


Building identical conda environments
=====================================

You can use explicit specification files to build an identical
conda environment on the same operating system platform, either
on the same machine or on a different machine.

Use the terminal or an Anaconda Prompt for the following steps:

#. Run ``conda list --explicit`` to produce a spec list such as:

   .. code::

      # This file may be used to create an environment using:
      # $ conda create --name <env> --file <this file>
      # platform: osx-64

      https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/free/osx-64/zlib-1.2.8-3.tar.bz2


#. To create this spec list as a file in the current working
   directory, run::

     conda list --explicit > spec-file.txt

   .. note::
      You can use ``spec-file.txt`` as the filename or replace
      it with a filename of your choice.

   An explicit spec file is not usually cross platform, and
   therefore has a comment at the top such as ``# platform: osx-64``
   showing the platform where it was created. This platform is the
   one where this spec file is known to work. On other platforms,
   the packages specified might not be available or dependencies
   might be missing for some of the key packages already in the
   spec.

   To use the spec file to create an identical environment on the
   same machine or another machine::

     conda create --name myenv --file spec-file.txt

   To use the spec file to install its listed packages into an
   existing environment::

     conda install --name myenv --file spec-file.txt

   Conda does not check architecture or dependencies when installing
   from a spec file. To ensure that the packages work correctly,
   make sure that the file was created from a working environment,
   and use it on the same architecture, operating system and
   platform, such as linux-64 or osx-64.


.. _activate-env:

Activating an environment
=========================

Activating environments is essential to making the software in the environments
work well. Activation entails two primary functions: adding entries to PATH for
the environment, and running any activation scripts that the environment may
contain. These activation scripts are how packages can set arbitrary
environment variables that may be necessary for their operation.

To activate an environment: ``conda activate myenv``

.. note::
   Replace ``myenv`` with the environment name or directory path.

Conda prepends the path name ``myenv`` onto your system command.

Windows is extremely sensitive to proper activation. This is because
the Windows library loader does not support the concept of libraries
and executables that know where to search for their dependencies
(RPATH). Instead, Windows relies on a standard library search order, defined at
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/7d83bc18(v=vs.140). If
environments are not active, libraries won't get found and there will be lots
of errors. HTTP or SSL errors are common errors when the
Python in a child environment can't find the necessary OpenSSL library.

Conda itself includes some special workarounds to add its necessary PATH
entries. This makes it so that it can be called without activation or
with any child environment active. In general, calling any executable in
an environment without first activating that environment will likely not work.
For the ability to run executables in activated environments, you may be
interested in the ``conda run`` command.

Conda init
----------

Earlier versions of conda introduced scripts to make activation
behavior uniform across operating systems. Conda 4.4 allowed
``conda activate myenv``. Conda 4.6 added extensive initialization
support so that conda works more quickly and less disruptively on
a wide variety of shells (bash, zsh, csh, fish, xonsh, and more).
Now these shells can use the ``conda activate`` command.
Removing the need to modify PATH makes conda less disruptive to
other software on your system. For more information, read the
output from ``conda init --help``.

One setting may be useful to you when using ``conda init`` is:

``auto_activate_base: bool``

This setting controls whether or not conda activates your base
environment when it first starts up. You'll have the ``conda``
command available either way, but without activating the environment,
none of the other programs in the environment will be available until
the environment is activated with ``conda activate base``. People
sometimes choose this setting to speed up the time their shell takes
to start up or to keep conda-installed software from automatically
hiding their other software.

Nested activation
-----------------

By default, ``conda activate`` will deactivate the current environment
before activating the new environment and reactivate it when
deactivating the new environment. Sometimes you may want to leave
the current environment PATH entries in place so that you can continue
to easily access command line programs from the first environment. 
This is most commonly encountered when common command-line utilities
are installed in the base environment. To retain the current environment
in the PATH, you can activate the new environment using:

``conda activate --stack myenv``

If you wish to always stack when going from the outermost environment, 
which is typically the base environment, you can set the ``auto_stack`` 
configuration option:

``conda config --set auto_stack 1``

You may specify a larger number for a deeper level of automatic stacking,
but this is not recommended since deeper levels of stacking are more likely
to lead to confusion.

Deactivating an environment
===========================

To deactivate an environment, type: ``conda deactivate``

Conda removes the path name for the currently active environment from
your system command.

.. note::
   To simply return to the base environment, it's better to call ``conda
   activate`` with no environment specified, rather than to try to deactivate. If
   you run ``conda deactivate`` from your base environment, you may lose the
   ability to run conda at all. Don't worry, that's local to this shell - you can
   start a new one. However, if the environment was activated using ``--stack``
   (or was automatically stacked) then it is better to use ``conda deactivate``.


.. _determine-current-env:

Determining your current environment
====================================

Use the terminal or an Anaconda Prompt for the following steps.

By default, the active environment---the one you are currently
using---is shown in parentheses () or brackets [] at the
beginning of your command prompt::

  (myenv) $

If you do not see this, run:

.. code::

   conda info --envs

In the environments list that displays, your current environment
is highlighted with an asterisk (*).

By default, the command prompt is set to show the name of the
active environment. To disable this option::

  conda config --set changeps1 false

To re-enable this option::

  conda config --set changeps1 true


Viewing a list of your environments
===================================

To see a list of all of your environments, in your terminal window or an
Anaconda Prompt, run:

.. code::

   conda info --envs

OR

.. code::

   conda env list

A list similar to the following is displayed:

.. code::

   conda environments:
   myenv                 /home/username/miniconda/envs/myenv
   snowflakes            /home/username/miniconda/envs/snowflakes
   bunnies               /home/username/miniconda/envs/bunnies

If this command is run by an administrator, a list of all environments
belonging to all users will be displayed.

Viewing a list of the packages in an environment
================================================

To see a list of all packages installed in a specific environment:

* If the environment is not activated, in your terminal window or an
  Anaconda Prompt, run:

  .. code-block:: bash

     conda list -n myenv

* If the environment is activated, in your terminal window or an
  Anaconda Prompt, run:

  .. code-block:: bash

     conda list

To see if a specific package is installed in an environment, in your
terminal window or an Anaconda Prompt, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda list -n myenv scipy


.. _pip-in-env:

Using pip in an environment
===========================

To use pip in your environment, in your terminal window or an
Anaconda Prompt, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -n myenv pip
   conda activate myenv
   pip <pip_subcommand>

Issues may arise when using pip and conda together. When combining conda and pip,
it is best to use an isolated conda environment. Only after conda has been used to
install as many packages as possible should pip be used to install any remaining
software. If modifications are needed to the environment, it is best to create a
new environment rather than running conda after pip. When appropriate, conda and
pip requirements should be stored in text files.

We recommend that you:

**Use pip only after conda**
  - Install as many requirements as possible with conda then use pip
  - Pip should be run with –upgrade-strategy only-if-needed (the default)
  - Do use pip with the –user argument, avoid all “users” installs

**Use conda environments for isolation**
  - Create a conda environment to isolate any changes pip makes
  - Environments take up little space thanks to hard links
  - Care should be taken to avoid running pip in the “root” environment

**Recreate the environment if changes are needed**
  - Once pip has been used, conda will be unaware of the changes
  - To install additional conda packages, it is best to recreate
    the environment

**Store conda and pip requirements in text files**
  - Package requirements can be passed to conda via the –file argument
  - Pip accepts a list of Python packages with -r or –requirements
  - Conda env will export or create environments based on a file with
    conda and pip requirements


Saving environment variables
============================

Conda environments can include saved environment variables.

Suppose you want an environment "analytics" to store both a
secret key needed to log in to a server and a path to a
configuration file. The sections below explain how to write a
script named ``env_vars`` to do this on :ref:`Windows
<win-save-env-variables>` and :ref:`macOS or Linux
<macos-linux-save-env-variables>`.

This type of script file can be part of a conda package, in
which case these environment variables become active when an
environment containing that package is activated.

You can name these scripts anything you like. However, multiple
packages may create script files, so be sure to use descriptive
names that are not used by other packages. One popular option is
to give the script a name in the form
``packagename-scriptname.sh``, or on Windows,
``packagename-scriptname.bat``.

.. _win-save-env-variables:

Windows
-------

#. Locate the directory for the conda environment in your
   Anaconda Prompt by running in the command shell ``%CONDA_PREFIX%``.

#. Enter that directory and create these subdirectories and
   files::

    cd %CONDA_PREFIX%
    mkdir .\etc\conda\activate.d
    mkdir .\etc\conda\deactivate.d
    type NUL > .\etc\conda\activate.d\env_vars.bat
    type NUL > .\etc\conda\deactivate.d\env_vars.bat

#. Edit ``.\etc\conda\activate.d\env_vars.bat`` as follows::

     set MY_KEY='secret-key-value'
     set MY_FILE=C:\path\to\my\file

#. Edit ``.\etc\conda\deactivate.d\env_vars.bat`` as follows::

     set MY_KEY=
     set MY_FILE=

When you run ``conda activate analytics``, the environment variables
MY_KEY and MY_FILE are set to the values you wrote into the file.
When you run ``conda deactivate``, those variables are erased.

.. _macos-linux-save-env-variables:

macOS and Linux
---------------

#. Locate the directory for the conda environment in your terminal window by running in the terminal ``echo $CONDA_PREFIX``.

#. Enter that directory and create these subdirectories and
   files::

     cd $CONDA_PREFIX
     mkdir -p ./etc/conda/activate.d
     mkdir -p ./etc/conda/deactivate.d
     touch ./etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh
     touch ./etc/conda/deactivate.d/env_vars.sh

#. Edit ``./etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh`` as follows::

     #!/bin/sh

     export MY_KEY='secret-key-value'
     export MY_FILE=/path/to/my/file/

#. Edit ``./etc/conda/deactivate.d/env_vars.sh`` as follows::

     #!/bin/sh

     unset MY_KEY
     unset MY_FILE

When you run ``conda activate analytics``, the environment
variables MY_KEY and MY_FILE are set to the values you wrote into
the file. When you run ``conda deactivate``, those variables are
erased.


Sharing an environment
=======================

You may want to share your environment with someone else---for
example, so they can re-create a test that you have done. To
allow them to quickly reproduce your environment, with all of its
packages and versions, give them a copy of your
``environment.yml file``.

Exporting the environment.yml file
----------------------------------

.. note::
   If you already have an ``environment.yml`` file in your
   current directory, it will be overwritten during this task.

#. Activate the environment to export: ``conda activate myenv``
   
   .. note::
      Replace ``myenv`` with the name of the environment.

#. Export your active environment to a new file::

     conda env export > environment.yml

   .. note::
      This file handles both the environment's pip packages
      and conda packages.

#. Email or copy the exported ``environment.yml`` file to the
   other person.

.. _create-env-file-manually:

Creating an environment file manually
-------------------------------------

You can create an environment file (environment.yml) manually
to share with others.

EXAMPLE: A simple environment file:

.. code::

    name: stats
    dependencies:
      - numpy
      - pandas

EXAMPLE: A more complex environment file:

.. code::

   name: stats2
   channels:
     - javascript
   dependencies:
     - python=3.4   # or 2.7
     - bokeh=0.9.2
     - numpy=1.9.*
     - nodejs=0.10.*
     - flask
     - pip:
       - Flask-Testing

.. note:: 
   Note the use of the wildcard * when defining the patch version
   number. Defining the version number by fixing the major and minor
   version numbers while allowing the patch version number to vary
   allows us to use our environment file to update our environment
   to get any bug fixes whilst still maintaining consistency of
   software environment.

You can exclude the default channels by adding ``nodefaults``
to the channels list.

.. code::

   channels:
     - javascript
     - nodefaults

This is equivalent to passing the ``--override-channels`` option
to most ``conda`` commands.

Adding ``nodefaults`` to the channels list in ``environment.yml``
is similar to removing ``defaults`` from the :ref:`channels
list <config-channels>` in the ``.condarc`` file. However,
changing ``environment.yml`` affects only one of your conda
environments while changing ``.condarc`` affects them all.

For details on creating an environment from this
``environment.yml`` file, see :ref:`create-env-from-file`.

Removing an environment
=======================

To remove an environment, in your terminal window or an
Anaconda Prompt, run:

.. code::

   conda remove --name myenv --all

You may instead use ``conda env remove --name myenv``.

To verify that the environment was removed, in your terminal window or an
Anaconda Prompt, run:

.. code::

   conda info --envs

The environments list that displays should not show the removed
environment.
